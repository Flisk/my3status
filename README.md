# my3status

This is my status line program. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is a modest C program that serves as my
[sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) status line generator, written for fun
and C practice. It currently displays:

  * Used disk space
  * System load and uptime
  * Battery level and estimated remaining charge/discharge time
  * Date and time

Not yet implemented:

  * WiFi status
  * PulseAudio volume level/mute state
