# my3status

This is my status line program. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is a modest C program that serves as my
[sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) status line generator, written for fun
and C practice. It currently displays:

  * ALSA volume level/mute state
  * Used disk space
  * System load and uptime
  * Battery level and remaining charge/discharge time *via UPower*
  * Date and time
